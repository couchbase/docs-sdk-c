The handler will unlock the item implicitly via modifying the item with the correct CAS.

If the item has already been locked, the server will respond with CasMismatch which means that the operation could not be executed temporarily, but may succeed later on.


== APIs and Additional Information

API information for working with CAS can be found https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-c-client/group__lcb-kv-api.html[in our API docs].
