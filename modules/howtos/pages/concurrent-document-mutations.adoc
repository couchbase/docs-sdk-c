Sometimes more logic is needed when performing updates, for example, if a property is mutually exclusive with another property; only one or the other can exist, but not both.

The handler will unlock the item implicitly via modifying the item with the correct CAS.

If the item has already been locked, the server will respond with CasMismatch which means that the operation could not be executed temporarily, but may succeed later on.


== APIs and Additional Information

API information for working with CAS can be found {lcb_api_link}/group__lcb-kv-api.html[in our API docs].

A fully worked example can be found {lcb_doc_src_link}/modules/devguide/examples/c/cas.cc[here^] and
{lcb_doc_src_link}/modules/devguide/examples/c/pessimistic-lock.cc[here^].
