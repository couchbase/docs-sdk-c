= Authenticating against Couchbase Server

[abstract]
As well as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Couchbase offers connection with Certificate Authentication, and works transparently with LDAP.


Our xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Getting Started] guide covered the basics for authorizing against a Couchbase cluster, but you may need to use alternative authentication methods such as Certification.


== RBAC

Our xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Getting Started] guide introduced basic authentication against a Couchbase cluster:

lcb_CREATEOPTS *create_options = NULL;
lcb_createopts_create(&create_options, LCB_TYPE_CLUSTER);
lcb_createopts_connstr(create_options, argv[1], strlen(argv[1]));
// username, password
lcb_createopts_credentials(create_options, argv[2], strlen(argv[2]), argv[3], strlen(argv[3]));

lcb_STATUS rc; /* return code, that have to be checked */
lcb_INSTANCE *instance;
rc = lcb_create(&instance, &create_options);
lcb_createopts_destroy(create_options);
rc = lcb_connect(instance);
rc = lcb_wait(instance);
rc = lcb_get_bootstrap_status(instance);

== Authenticating a Scala Client by Certificate

For sample procedures whereby certificates can be generated and deployed, see xref:7.0@server:manage:manage-security/manage-certificates.adoc[Manage Certificates].
The rest of this document assumes that the processes there, or something similar, have been followed.
That is, a cluster certificate has been created and installed on the server, a client certificate has been created, and it is stored in a JVM keystore along with the cluster's certificate.
