[abstract]
The C++ Transactions built upon the C SDK.


Transactions are not available directly via the C SDK. Although our C+\+ Distributed ACID Transactions are built upon the C SDK it doesn't expose any C symbols explicitly. 
Applications built using C SDK and C++ Transactions can run in parallel without interfering with each other -- 
more details on our xref:1.0@cxx-txns::distributed-acid-transactions-from-the-sdk.adoc[C++ Distributed Transactions] pages.
