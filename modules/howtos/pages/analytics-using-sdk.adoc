{description}

For complex and long-running queries, involving large ad hoc join, set, aggregation, and grouping operations, Couchbase Data Platform offers the xref:7.0@server:analytics:introduction.adoc[Couchbase Analytics Service (CBAS)].
This is the analytic counterpart to our xref:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[operational data focussed Query Service].
The analytics service is available in Couchbase Data Platform 6.0 and later (developer preview in 5.5).


== Getting Started

After familiarizing yourself with our xref:7.0@server:analytics:primer-beer.adoc[introductory primer],
in particular creating a dataset and linking it to a bucket to shadow the operational data,
try Couchbase Analytics using the Go SDK.
Intentionally, the API for analytics is very similar to that of the query service.
In these examples we will be using an `airports` dataset created on the `travel-sample` bucket.

In C SDK 2.x, Analytics was only available on the `Bucket` object;
in C SDK 3.x, Analytics queries are submitted using the Cluster reference, not a Bucket or Collection:

NOTE: When using a Couchbase version < 6.5 you must create a valid Bucket connection using `cluster.Bucket(name)` before you can use Analytics.


Here is an example of doing an analytics query :

[source,c]
----
include::example$analytics.cc[tag=analytics,indent=0]
----

For a full example, see the {lcb_api_link}/example_2analytics_2analytics_8c-example.html[API documentation].


== Analytics Result

When performing an analytics query, `lcb_RESPANALYTICS` is delivered in the `lcb_ANALYTICS_CALLBACK` function for each result row received.

[source,c]
----
include::example$analytics.cc[tag=result, indent=0]
----


== Analytics Options

The analytics service provides an array of options to customize your query. The following table lists them :

.Available Analytics options
[options="header"]
|====
| Name    | Description
| `lcb_cmdanalytics_reset(command)` | Reset the structure so that it may be reused for a subsequent analytics query.
| `lcb_cmdanalytics_encoded_payload(command,query,query length)` | Get the JSON-encoded analytics query payload.
| `lcb_cmdanalytics_payload(command, query, query length)` | Sets the JSON-encodes analytics query payload to be executed.
| `lcb_cmdanalytics_statement(command, statement, statement length )` | Sets the actual statement to be executed.
| `lcb_cmdanalytics_scope_name(command, scope name, scope length)` | Associate scope name with the analytics query.
| `lcb_cmdanalytics_named_param(command, argument name, name length, argument value, value length)` | Sets a named argument for the analytics query.
| `lcb_cmdanalytics_positional_param(command, argument value, argument length)` | Adds a positional argument for the analytics query.
| `lcb_cmdanalytics_readonly(command, readonly)` | Marks analytics query as read-only ( set readonly value to non zero ).

== Queries

A query can either be `simple` or be `parameterized`. If parameters are used, they can either be `positional` or `named`.
Here is one example of each:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/analytics-simple-query.go[tag=simple]
----

The query may be performed with positional parameters:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/analytics-positional-placeholders.go[tag=positional]
----

Alternatively, the query may be performed with named parameters:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/analytics-named-placeholders.go[tag=named]
----

NOTE: As timeouts are propagated to the server by the client, a timeout set on the client side may be used to stop the processing of a request, in order to save system resources.
See example in the next section.


== Options

Additional parameters may be sent as part of the query.
There are currently three parameters:

* *Client Context ID*, sets a context ID that is returned back as part of the result.
Uses `ClientContextID string` default is a random UUID
* *Timeout*, customizes the timeout sent to the server.
Does not usually have to be set, as the client sets it based on the timeout on the operation.
Uses `Timeout time.Duration`, and defaults to the Analytics timeout set on the client (75s).
This can be adjusted at the xref:ref:client-settings.adoc#timeout-options[cluster global config level].
* *Priority*, set if the request should have priority over others.
The `Priority bool` option defaults to `false`.


Here, we give the request priority over others, and set a custom, server-side timeout value:

== Handling the Response

These query result may contain various sorts of data and metadata,
depending upon the nature of the query,
as you will have seen when working through our xref:7.0@server:analytics:primer-beer.adoc[introductory primer].

Results are iterated using the `Next` function.
Within the `for` loop the result is read using the `Row` by supplying a pointer to the variable in which to store the value.
Always remember to check the error value of `Err` after iterating the results, this is where any errors occurring whilst calling `Next` will be returned.

include::devguide:example$go/analytics-simple-query.go[tag=results]
----

// Move these to Error reference doc?
Common errors are listed in our xref:ref:error-codes.adoc#analytics-errors[Errors Reference doc], with errors caused by resource unavailability (such as timeouts and _Operation cannot be performed during rebalance_ messages) leading to an xref:howtos:error-handling.adoc#retry[automatic retry] by the SDK.

If you only expect a single result or only want to use the first result in a results set then you can use `One`
(note: this function will iterate any remaining rows in the resultset so can only be called once and should only be used on small results sets):

[source,golang,indent=0]

Moving these to error reference doc
----
21002: Request timed out and will be cancelled
23000: Analytics Service is temporarily unavailable
23003: Operation cannot be performed during rebalance
23007: Job queue is full with [string] jobs
----


=== MetaData

The `AnalyticsResultsMetadata` object contains useful metadata, such as `Metrics` and `ClientContextID`.
Note that before metadata can be accessed the results object must be closed.
Here is a snippet using several items of metadata
