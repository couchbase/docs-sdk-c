[abstract]
Fields within a document can be securely encrypted by the SDK, to support FIPS-140-2 compliance.

Field Level Encryption is normally carried out at a higher level than _libcouchbase_ (LCB).
It is available in the LCB 'wrapper' SDKs: Node.js and Python.
It will be available in a later release of the other LCB 'wrapper' SDKs, PHP.
It will not be available in LCB.
