Client-side implementation of Field Level Encryption is available in the xref:3.1@java-sdk:concept-docs:encryption.adoc[3.x Java version of the SDK]. 
It will be enabled in a future release of the other third generation SDKs.

NOTE: Field Level Encryption is normally carried out at a higher level than _libcouchbase_ (LCB).
It will be available in a later release of the LCB 'wrapper' SDKs: Node.js, PHP, Python.
It will not be available in LCB.
