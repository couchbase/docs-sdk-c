{description}
Several data structures are supported by the other SDKs, including map, list, queue, and set.

The power to search, query, and easily work with data in Couchbase, comes from the choice of JSON as a storage format.
Non-JSON storage is supported -- see the xref:nonjson.adoc[Binary Storage Documentation] -- 
including UTF-8 strings, raw sequences of bytes, and language specific serializations,
however, only JSON is supported by xref:n1ql-query.adoc[Query].

In Couchbase, JSON’s key-value structure allows the storage of collection data structures such as lists, maps, sets and queues.
JSON’s tree-like structure allows operations against xref:subdocument-operations.adoc[specific paths in the Document],
and efficient support for these data structures.
The data structure API is not available in the C SDK, but the sub-document API (which the data structure feature uses) can be used to attain the same results with the same performance profile.
The best way to inter-operate with data structures as provided by other Couchbase SDKs is to use either full-document operations or sub-document operations.
// The section on xref:document-operations.adoc[Sub-Document Operations] shows how C applications can manipulate these data structures.

== Data Structure to Sub-document Operations

The following table may be used to help you perform data structure operations by using sub-document operations.
Note that some data structure operations may consist of one or more sub-document operations.

`LCB_SDCMD_xxx` constants are assumed to be used in a context similar to the following (refer to the xref:document-operations.adoc[Sub-Document Operations] page for more details).

[source,c]
----
lcb_SDSPEC spec = { 0 };
lcb_CMDSUBDOC cmd = { 0 };
cmd.specs = &spec;
cmd.nspecs = 1;

LCB_CMD_SET_KEY(&cmd, docid, strlen(docid));
LCB_SDSPEC_SET_PATH(&spec, path, strlen(path)); // Can be an empty string where applicable
LCB_SDSPEC_SET_VALUE(&spec, value, strlen(value));
spec.sdcmd = LCB_SDCMD_DICT_UPSERT;

.Data Structure to Sub-document Mapping
|===
| Data Structure Operation | Sub-document Equivalent

| `MapGet(docid, mapkey)`
a|
[source,c]
----
spec.sdcmd = LCB_SDCMD_GET;
LCB_SDSPEC_SET_PATH(&spec, mapkey, mapkey_len);
----

| `MapRemove(docid, mapkey)`
a|
[source,c]
----
spec.sdcmd = LCB_SDCMD_DICT_UPSERT;
LCB_SDSPEC_SET_PATH(&spec, mapkey, mapkey_len);
----

| `MapSize(docid)`
| Your application should fetch the entire document, parse it with a JSON parser, and derive the size.
// There will be an atomic operation to perform this on the server in
// the future.

| `MapAdd(docid, mapkey, value)`
a|
[source,c]
----
spec.sdcmd = LCB_SDCMD_DICT_ADD;
LCB_SDSPEC_SET_PATH(&spec, mapkey, mapkey_len);
LCB_SDSPEC_SET_VALUE(&spec, value, value_len);
----

| `ListGet(docid, index)`
a|
[source,c]
----
spec.sdcmd = LCB_SDCMD_GET;
std::string path = "[" + std::to_string(index) + "]";
LCB_SDSPEC_SET_PATH(&spec, path.c_str(), path.size());
----

| `ListAppend(docid, value)`
a|
[source,c]
----
spec.sdcmd = LCB_SDCMD_ARRAY_ADD_LAST;
LCB_SDCMD_SET_PATH(&spec, "", 0);
LCB_SDCMD_SET_VALUE(&spec, value, value_len);
----

| `ListPrepend(docid, value)`
a|
[source,c]
----
spec.sdcmd = LCB_SDCMD_ARRAY_ADD_FIRST;
LCB_SDCMD_SET_PATH(&spec, "", 0);
LCB_SDCMD_SET_VALUE(&spec, value, value_len);
----

| `ListSize(docid)`
| See notes on `MapSize`.

| `SetContains(docid, value)`
| Not available as a native operation.
Your application should fetch the document and parse it (as a JSON array) and then determine if the item exists.

| `SetAdd(docid, value)`
a|
NOTE: This requires that the set contains only JSON primitives (i.e.
numeric, string, boolean, and null values).

[source,c]
----
spec.sdcmd = LCB_SDCMD_ARRAY_ADD_UNIQUE;
LCB_SDCMD_SET_PATH(&spec, "", 0);
LCB_SDCMD_SET_VALUE(&spec, value, value_len);
----

| `SetSize(docid)`
| See notes on `MapSize`

| `SetRemove(docid, value)`
a|
Not available as a native operation.
Your application should perform the following:

. Fetch the document (make note of the CAS value).
. Parse the value as JSON.
. Get the index of the item.
. Perform another sub-document operation using the [.api]`LCB_SDCMD_REMOVE` command with the index (i.e.
`"[" + std::to_string(index) + "]"`) as the path.
*Ensure to pass the CAS to the remove operation*, i.e.
+
----
sdcmd.cas = cas_from_step_1;
----

. If the removal results in an [.api]`LCB_KEY_EEXISTS` then it means another client has modified the set since step #1, and you must go back to step #1.
Otherwise, the removal is complete.

| `QueuePush(docid, value)`
| This is an alias to `ListPrepend`

| `QueuePop(docid)`
a|
Not available as a native operation because the returned value may be lost in transit.
To perform this operation in your application:

. Fetch the _last_ item of the list:
+
[source,c]
----
spec.sdcmd = LCB_SDCMD_GET;
LCB_SDSPEC_SET_PATH(&spec, "[-1]", 4);
----
+
Take note of the CAS when the operation completes.

. If the operation results in an [.api]`LCB_SUBDOC_PATH_ENOENT` error then the queue is empty.
. Remove the item from the queue:
+
[source,c]
----
spec.sdcmd = LCB_SDCMD_GET;
LCB_SDSPEC_SET_PATH(&spec, "[-1]", 4);
----
+
Ensure to pass the CAS as well:
+
----
sdcmd.cas = cas_from_step_1;
----

. If the operation fails with [.api]`LCB_SUBDOC_PATH_EEXISTS` then someone else has modified the queue (possibly by trying to process the last item) as well.
Go back to step 1.

NOTE: If you are using the queue as a job queue, ensure that you do not process the item until it is fully removed from the queue, as it is possible another client/application thread will retrieve the same queue item and try to process it as well.
