= Migrating from SDK2 to SDK3 API
:description: The 3.0 API breaks the existing 2.0 APIs in order to provide a number of improvements. \
Collections and Scopes are introduced.
:nav-title: Migrating to C SDK 3.0 API
:page-topic-type: concept
:page-aliases: ROOT:migrate

[abstract]
{description}
The Document class and structure has been completely removed from the API, and the returned value is now `Result`.
Retry behaviour is more proactive, and lazy bootstrapping moves all error handling to a single place.
Individual behavior changes across services are explained here.

////
As an example here is a KeyValue document fetch:

// change to $Your_language
[source,java]
----
GetResult getResult = collection.get("key", getOptions().timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3));
----

Compare this to a N1QL query:

// change to $Your_language
[source,java]
----
QueryResult queryResult = cluster.query("select 1=1", queryOptions().timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3));
----

Information on the new API is to be found in the {lcb_api_link}/index.html[libcouchbase API pages].

// CCBC-1103 & CCBC-1115

// Outline below for individual SDKs -- please expand as appropriate, many topics can be covered lightly
//
// Please use before(2.n) / after (3.0) snippets in all cases where it is helpful
// (probably nearly everywhere, I'm afraid)


===  Installation and Configuration

 - where to get the new artifacts / vs old place
 - discuss new dependencies if needed
 - discuss configuration old and new, especially if certain
   custom options are not present anymore (why they are not used)
   and how users might want to transfer this config over to the
   new one
 - discuss cert auth
 - discuss encryption config

===  Connection Lifecycle

 - discuss bootstrapping
 - important: bootstrapping is now "lazy" so also discuss how to do the eager
   checks and any impact it might have on the first op being slow?
 - discuss shutdown
 - if external state is passed in optionally, discuss
   management of this state
 - discuss the impact of 6.5 "gcccp" and cluster level queries
 - SASL by default on non-PLAIN (if applicable)

===  Exception Handling

 - discuss new exception hierachy in principle and how users should
   approach it when migrating
 - explain maybe new error handling strategies that are in place,
   around retry strategies especially and their behavior

=== Serialization and Transcoding

 - describe how it works for your language, how to override and any platform-specific
   encoding and decoding guidelines. 
 - Also important how to convert from the document types to the new approach

=== Logging and Events

 - discuss any changes to the logging infrastructure or event system if made

===  Migrating Services

 - one section for each service that goes in-depth on each command 
   and discusses old vs. new

==== Key Value

 - don't forget the get replica changes!

==== Query

==== Analytics

=== Search

 - especial focus, since the API has been reordered quite a bit
 - if applicable: Change in FTS Geospatial Lat/Lon ordering (i.e. node)

=== Views

 - don't forget that the consistency bit has been renamed, biggest change there

== Management APIs

 - discusses how to migrate from each old management api to the new one
 - where it is found, what exceptions it throws, etc.
