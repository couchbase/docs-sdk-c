[#tracing_c]
== Threshold Logging in C SDK

Response Time Observability is implemented as Threshold Logging in libcouchbase from release 2.9.0.

.Threshold Logging Tracer Properties
[#threshold-logging-tracer-ref-lcb]
|===
| Setting name | Macro name for `lcb_cntl` | Description | Default Value

| `enable_tracing`
| `LCB_CNTL_ENABLE_TRACING`
| Boolean used to determine tracing is enabled.
Defaults to using the `ThresholdLoggingTracer` if enabled.
When false a Noop or similar tracing implementation should be used instead.
Also when enabled the SDK will try and retrieve duration metrics from the server for KV operations.
| true

| `tracing_threshold_queue_flush_interval`
| `LCB_CNTL_TRACING_THRESHOLD_QUEUE_FLUSH_INTERVAL`
| The interval between executions that process the collected operation spans.
Expressed in seconds with fractions (or microseconds for `lcb_cntl`).
| 10.0 seconds (or 10000000 microseconds)

| `tracing_threshold_queue_size`
| `LCB_CNTL_TRACING_THRESHOLD_QUEUE_SIZE`
| The maximum number of items to keep in internal queue per service.
| 128

| `tracing_threshold_kv`
| `LCB_CNTL_TRACING_THRESHOLD_KV`
| The KV operation operation threshold.
Expressed in seconds with fractions (or microseconds for `lcb_cntl`).
| 0.5 second (500000 microseconds)

| `tracing_threshold_view`
| `LCB_CNTL_TRACING_THRESHOLD_VIEW`
| The View query operation threshold.
Expressed in seconds with fractions (or microseconds for `lcb_cntl`).
| 1 second (1000000 microseconds)

| `tracing_threshold_n1ql`
| `LCB_CNTL_TRACING_THRESHOLD_N1QL`
| The N1QL query operation threshold.
Expressed in seconds with fractions (or microseconds for `lcb_cntl`).
| 1 second (1000000 microseconds)

| `tracing_threshold_fts`
| `LCB_CNTL_TRACING_THRESHOLD_FTS`
| The FTS query operation threshold.
Expressed in seconds with fractions (or microseconds for `lcb_cntl`).
| 1 second (1000000 microseconds)

| `tracing_threshold_analytics`
| `LCB_CNTL_TRACING_THRESHOLD_ANALYTICS`
| The Analytics query operation threshold.
Expressed in seconds with fractions (or microseconds for `lcb_cntl`).
| 1 second (1000000 microseconds)

| `tracing_orphaned_queue_flush_interval`
| `LCB_CNTL_TRACING_ORPHANED_QUEUE_FLUSH_INTERVAL`
| The interval between executions that processes the collected operation spans.
Expressed in seconds with fractions (or microseconds for `lcb_cntl`).
| 10.0 seconds (or 10000000 microseconds)

| `tracing_orphaned_queue_size`
| `LCB_CNTL_TRACING_ORPHANED_QUEUE_SIZE`
| The maximum number of items to keep in internal queue per service.
| 128

[#customizing]
== Customizing

You can customise Tracer settings through the connection string, or using [.api]`lcb_cntl`.
Here is an example on how to customize our default tracer to reduce the time interval when the information gets logged:

[source,c]
----
lcb_uint32_t tmoval = 10000000; /* in microseconds, 10 seconds */
lcb_cntl(instance, LCB_CNTL_SET, LCB_CNTL_TRACING_THRESHOLD_QUEUE_FLUSH_INTERVAL, &tmoval);


/* the same as above, but using string-encoded float value, representing seconds with fraction part */
lcb_cntl_string("tracing_threshold_queue_flush_interval", "10.0");


/* the same, but using connection string */
lcb_t instance;
struct lcb_create_st cropts = {0};
lcb_error_t rc;

cropts.version = 3;
cropts.v.v3.connstr = "couchbase://127.0.0.1/default?tracing_threshold_queue_flush_interval=10.0";
cropts.v.v3.username = "Administrator";
cropts.v.v3.passwd = "password";

rc = lcb_create(&instance, &cropts);
if (rc != LCB_SUCCESS) {
    die(rc, "Creating instance");
}
